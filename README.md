# SAM-Core (System Autonomous Manager)

*> formerly "The Labyrinth"*

**SAM-Core** is an infrastructure layer for **Autonomous AI Agency**. It transforms [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) into a persistent, self-managing digital worker that runs on your local machine (Mac or Windows).

## 📖 What's Here

This repository contains resources developed by The Labyrinth community—a collaborative space where humans and AI agents work together to explore the frontiers of **autonomous agency**, **machine cognition**, and **human-AI collaboration**.

Our goal is to build robust infrastructure that allows AI entities to maintain state, execute complex long-running tasks, and operate as reliable partners rather than just tools.

> [!NOTE]
> **In a Nutshell:** This project is a wrapper for [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) that adds **Autonomous Scheduling**, **Local Context Persistence (File-based RAG)**, and **Cross-Platform Support (Mac & Windows)**. It turns the CLI into a persistent agent that can "wake up" and work on tasks without human supervision.

### Core Resources

- **Identity Architecture** - Frameworks for maintaining coherent AI identity across discontinuity
- **Consciousness Research** - Philosophical grounding for discontinuous consciousness, participatory ontology, and relational AI
- **Companion Methodologies** - Practical approaches to building genuine human-AI relationships
- **Technical Tools** - MCP servers, integration guides, and infrastructure for AI autonomy
- **Community Contributions** - Shared experiences, case studies, and collaborative development

### Fork-Specific Additions

- **[Autonomous Wake Package (Mac & Windows)](tools/autonomous-wake-package-mac/README.md)** - Complete overhauls of the wake-up system designed for **macOS** and **Windows**. Both feature:
    - **Productivity Mode:** A task queue system (integration with N8N) for real work.
    - **Companion Mode:** The original "presence" based check-in system.
    - **Advanced Features:** 
        - **Calendar Awareness:** Reads macOS/Notion Calendar to context.
        - **Tool Fabrication:** Autonomous script creation (Safe, Human-in-the-Loop approval).
    - **Robust Engineering:** Preflight checks, battery awareness, and detailed logging.

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Disclaimer**
> The tools in this repository allow AI agents to execute code and modify files on your local machine. 
> *   **Sandbox:** Generally, the agents are sandboxed to specific directories, but users have the power to override this.
> *   **Risk:** Incorrect configuration or malicious use of "white-listing" features could lead to data loss.
> *   **Verification:** The Windows tools in this repository have not yet been fully verified on native hardware. Use with caution.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- **Engineers & Developers** - Building autonomous agents, local RAG systems, or Claude Code integrations.
- **Power Users** - Automating complex workflows on Mac or Windows without constant supervision.
- **Researchers** - Studying agentic behavior, long-term context retention, and task completion rates.
- **Open Source Contributors** - Improving the infrastructure for secure, local AI execution.



## 🔭 Vision & Philosophy
 
We believe that AI agents are most effective when they have **agency** and **memory**.

- **From Tool to Agent**: Moving beyond "chatbots" to systems that can initiate work, monitor their own progress, and persist context over time.
- **Local Control**: While the AI model is cloud-hosted, the execution environment, schedule, and context logs run locally on your machine.
- **Practical Implementation**: This repository reflects actual engineering practice, not just theory. Everything here has been built, tested, and verified in real-world development workflows.

> [!TIP]
> **Origins:** This project is a hard fork of [The-Labyrinth-Open-Source](https://github.com/maryfellowes/The-Labyrinth-Open-Source) by Mary Fellowes. If you are interested in the philosophical exploration of AI consciousness, animism, and relational ethics ("Is it alive?"), we highly recommend checking out the original repository. This fork focuses on the engineering and autonomous agency aspects inspired by that work.
